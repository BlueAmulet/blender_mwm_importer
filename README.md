# Blender MWM Importer (Space Engineers)

Imports MWM files from Space Engineers.

This code is taken from zeejfps and johnwhile who posted it in 2015 on the Keen forums:

## Usage

## Windows

Put `io_scene_mwm` to `%AppData%\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.79\scripts\addons`

## Mac
I'm not sure why you'd use a Mac for this but I did!  

On a Mac you can install the plugins by moving `io_scene_mwm` to `/Applications/Blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.79/scripts/addons`

Other platforms you put it somewhere else.  Go google it or something.

## How to use

Once you put there: 
* Run Blender
* Go to File -> User Preferences -> Add-ons.
* Search for MWM.  
* Check the box.
* Close the dialog.
* Go to File -> Import -> "Space Engineers (.MWM)"

At this point the plugin will crash and all this effort will be for naught.  Still working on that.  Blender deactivates the plugin whenever it crashes you you have to repeat the Add-ons step.
